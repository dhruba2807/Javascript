        <span> <B> A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you
                to
                associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets
                asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the
                final
                value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the
                future.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        A Promise is in one of these states:
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>
            pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
            fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
            rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
            The eventual state of a pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason
            (error). When either of these options occur, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's then
            method are called. If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a corresponding handler is
            attached, the handler will be called, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous operation
            completing and its handlers being attached.
