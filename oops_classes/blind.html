        //   handleClick(): Defines the method that is called when the button is clicked.

}
//The Person class has a greet method that logs a greeting message using this.name.
//The delayedGreet method uses setTimeout to call greet after a delay.
//Without bind(this), this inside greet would be undefined because setTimeout changes the context.
//By using bind(this), we ensure that greet is called with the correct context (john).

const john = new Person("John");
john.delayedGreet(); // "Hello, my name is John" after 1 second

///Using Arrow Function
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    greet = () => {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
    }

    delayedGreet() {
        setTimeout(this.greet, 1000);
    }
}
// The bind() method is used to set the this context for functions, which is useful in callbacks and event handlers.
// Arrow functions can also be used to maintain the this context because they inherit it from the surrounding lexical scope.
// Understanding and controlling the this context is crucial for writing effective and bug-free JavaScript code.

const john1 = new Person("John");
john.delayedGreet(); // "Hello, my name is John" after 1 second
