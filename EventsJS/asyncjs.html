/*The first line of the body of function foo is executed synchronously, with the await expression configured with the pending promise. Progress through foo is then suspended and control is yielded back to the function that called foo.
Some time later, when the first promise has either been fulfilled or rejected, control moves back into foo. The result of the first promise fulfillment (if it was not rejected) is returned from the await expression. Here 1 is assigned to result1. Progress continues, and the second await expression is evaluated. Again, progress through foo is suspended and control is yielded.
Some time later, when the second promise has either been fulfilled or rejected, control re-enters foo. The result of the second promise resolution is returned from the second await expression. Here 2 is assigned to result2. Control moves to the return expression (if any). The default return value of undefined is returned as the resolution value of the current promise.*/
